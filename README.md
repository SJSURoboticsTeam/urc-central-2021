## How To Track Progress

### The Pillar of Progress: Issues

On SJSU Robotics, the main element that will be used to determine progress on
the project are **issues**.  You can see the issues tab near the top part of
this page. Issues can be many things. They can be:

- Mechanical structural defects
- Incorrect placement of compoents on a PCB
- Low performance by controls to control the direction of the steering motors
- Incorrect behavior of a button on the webpage

But they can also be used for "Tasks and assignments" such as:

- Sketch up concept for adjustable camera leg mount
- Write up block diagram of control flow information
- Add buttons for camera control on captin's page.
- Change daisy chain connector pinout from BNO055 to MPU6050 for arm

So issues can be used for both, problems, and tasks. They can also be used to
document the progress on a task. They contain a comments sections that can
be used to discuss the finds and concerns of other members regarding the issue.

### When to Add Issues

Anytime you are working on something that does not have

### Each issue must have

- A project(s) that it belongs to such as the drive or arm subsystems.
- A label indicating which division it is meant for
